mafw-gst-renderer (0.1.2009.22-2) unstable; urgency=low
  * MAFW gst renderer, pre-release 0.2009.22-2
  * We switch volume manager volume to the just set so we signal it directly
    when the change is requested. We don't signal any change in the volume
    subscription if we have and operation in progress.
  * We keep the pa_operation when writing the volume and cancel it and unref
    it when a new one comes.
  * Changed requested_* structure members to current_* in volume manager
  * Renamed volume and mute structure members to pulse_* in volume manager.
  * Fixed a small problem with mute. We were forgetting to set it when
    sending it to pulse.
  * Changed timeout interval for setting volume to 200ms.
  * We just change the volume as soon as we get the first call and then we
    add the timeout to filter following changes.
  * Improved rounding volumes as we signalled different ones from the one we
    were setting.
  * Added protections to public methods so that they are not called when
    volume manager is not alive yet.
  * Minor changes when falling back to playbin usage.
