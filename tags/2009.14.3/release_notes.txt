mafw-gst-renderer (0.1.2009.14-4) unstable; urgency=low
  * MAFW gst renderer, pre-release 0.2009.14-4
  * Update playcount id should be 0 while _notify_play is run in renderer
    so it doesn have sense checking about that

    timeout id in renderer.
  * Moved the code to remove the update_playcount to the state class to fix
    state pattern.
  * _update_playcount_cb made public inside the renderer to be called from other 
    parts of it.
  * Moved the code to add the timeout to state-transitioning.
  * Moved the code from the state notify_eos in the base renderer to the 
    state-playing.
