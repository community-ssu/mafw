mafw-gst-renderer (0.1.2009.21-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * MAFW gst renderer, pre-release 0.2009.21-1
  * Do not reuse video sink for now, somehow it gets
    broken after some time and as a result we cannot set XID of target
    video window to use.
  * Create and configure audio and video sinks once, then provide these
    to playbin2 when a new pipeline is created.
  * Changed _handle_duration to use _check_duration and added for
    seekability too.
  * Reworked _query_duration_and_seekability into _check_duration and _check
    seekability.
  * Added timeout to query duration and seekability and changed when it was
    called.
  * Set timeout id to 0 when timeout is removed
  * Used function to compare duration in seconds instead of comparing pure
    nano seconds.
  * Added function to compare durations in seconds.
  * Query duration and seek after buffering is complete.
  * Reworked adding the timeout to use a function.
  * Modified seekability emission to be done only with changes and adapted
    to type changes.
  * Modified duration emission to be emitted only with changes.
  * Media seekability initialized to unknown when playback begins.
  * SeekabilityType renamed and moved to renderer worker.
  * Renderer worker seekability uses its type now instead of gboolean.
  * Stored duration and seek timeout id to be able to remove it later in
    renderer worker.
  * Added query for duration and seekability some seconds after going to
    PLAYING to have more accurate information from GStreamer in renreder
    worker.
  * Reworked _finalize_startup in renderer worker into _finalize_startup and
    _query_duration_and_seekability. The first uses now the second.
  * Set pulse sink's latency-time property to half of buffer-time,
    this provides double buffering capabilities and should also help
    with avoiding audio glitches. Also, removed buffering for volume
    pipeline, since that is not needed.

  * This reverts commit r208.

mafw-upnp-source (0.1.2009.21-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * MAFW uPnP source, pre-release 0.2009.21-1
  * Changed code to detect seekability in upnp source to make it a bit
    better readable. For non containers, it sets default to 0 and it is only
    set to 1 if parameter is found and it is 1.
