mafw-gst-renderer (0.1.2009.19-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * MAFW gst renderer, pre-release 0.2009.19-1
  * Fixes power management issues caused by the volume pipeline
    being always in PAUSED state. While a proper implementation
    for volume management is not in place, this temporal fix
    workarounds the problem by setting it to PAUSED on demand
    when global volume has to be read, and then setting it back
    to READY.
  * Do not check video caps on prepare-xwindow-id, instead wait
    for prerolling to finish, otherwise caps are not set yet.
  * Use 'g_timeout_add_seconds' where possible.
  * Added monitor volume hack again, but when going to playing instead of
    stopping.
  * Revert "Added monitor_hack again but called only when stopping the worker."
  * Added monitor_hack again but called only when stopping the worker.
  * Revert "Added dirty hack to be aware of the volume changes that don't 
    happen"
  * Revert "Hack to monitor volume does not return TRUE, but FALSE and 
    reinstalls"
  * Improved playlist-change handling
  * Hack to monitor volume does not return TRUE, but FALSE and reinstalls
    the timeout not to do it at regular intervals, but a timeout after last
    callback is run.
  * Do not go to PLAYING state until we are done buffering.
  * Disable native flags in playbin2 temporarily since this is causing
    trouble with some videos. Also, allow videos with resolution 
    up to 848x576.
  * Added dirty hack to be aware of the volume changes that don't happen
    inside mafw code. As soon as GStreamer adds notify::volume signals, we
    have to remove this immediately.
  * Setting volume when playing is done only for playback volume.
  * Moved volume management from playback pipeline to volume pipeline. We
    don't update the volume pipeline because it should be updated but we do it
    with the playback one because it has always to be set up.
  * Moved listening to volume signals from playback pipeline to volume
    pipeline in renderer
  * Added customized pipeline to always listen to volume changes in renderer
  * Added support to distinguish between audio and video codec errors.
  * Fixed critical warning message.
  * When we get the ckey coming from the sync bus to the async bus, we check
    the caps and raise an error if they are not suitable.

mafw-iradio-source (0.1.2009.19-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * MAFW iradio source, pre-release 0.2009.19-1
  * Updating DB, if there is a new vendor-file
  * Adding 'added' metadata at building the default bookmarks
  * Adding duration support for default bookmarks
  * Modified mafw-tracker-source rules.
  * Source code moved to Gnome.

mafw-shared (0.1.2009.19-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * MAFW Shared, pre-release 0.2009.19-1
  * Compilation fix
  * Use 'g_timeout_add_seconds' where possible.
  * Merged branch 'get_metadatas_v4' changes r35:133 into the trunk.
  * Remove remaining wrong NameOwnerChanged signal handlers
  * Do not use NameOwnerChanged signal for detecting extension-startup

mafw-test-gui (0.1.2009.19-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * MAFW Test GUI, pre-release 0.2009.19-1
  * Check if metadata is not NULL before trying to get data.
  * Better playlist-change handling
  * Removed function to change volume in GUI as it was only used by hardware
    keys handlers.
  * Removed hardware keys volume control from GUI as this is done by gst.
  * Fixed a compilation warning.
  * No need to show an info note when we get metadata for an item that's 
    not in the view, just ignoring this is ok.

mafw-tracker-source (0.1.2009.19-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * MAFW tracker source, pre-release 0.2009.19-1
  * Check first if key is related with album-art or thumbnail when inserting in 
    the cache.
  * When getting metadata from just one clip, don't ask tracker for the URI 
    value: it's just already coded in objectid.
  * Handle the case when some entry is not found in tracker within get_metadatas
    function.
  * Fix unit tests.
  * Improved performance implementing the playlist browse in terms of
    get multiple metadatas function.
  * Fixing an error in get_metadatas, call the user callback in case tracker
    returns an error.
  * Handle keys not supported in the service in a different way in the cache.
  * Do not allow empty values by default, except for a couple of keys.
  * Add types for each tracker key.
  * Use in cache information about data types.
  * Added a function to retrieve metadata from a key.
  * Some keys are special from the point of view of cache. Mark them.
  * Register dependencies between keys.
  * Group keys depending the service they belong (tracker, album-art or
    thumbnails).
  * Add a field to know if a key allows empty values ("" and 0 are considered
    empty).
  * Add info about writable keys.
  * Renaming some functions.
  * Adding a letter so we can known which service belongs each tracker key.
  * Added a hashtable to register both value types and converstions from mafw 
    keys to tracker keys.
  * Use a more efficient function for string emptiness comparison.
  * Remove _unknown_value_allowed function.
  * Fixed unit tests for multiple get_metadatas.
  * Merged branch 'get_metadatas_v4' changes r35:133 into the trunk.
  * Removed unused functions of the Tracker mockup.
  * Fixing browse unit tests.
  * Fixing get_metadata unit tests.

mafw-upnp-source (0.1.2009.19-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * MAFW uPnP source, pre-release 0.2009.19-1
  * Removed useless warning message and fixed critical error message.
  * If browse with a skip count > 0 returns
    no results, invoke the user callback with appropriate
    parameters. Also, when browsing an empty container, do not return 
    an error.
