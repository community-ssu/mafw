mafw-gst-renderer (0.1.2009.17-2) unstable; urgency=low
  * MAFW gst renderer, pre-release 0.2009.17-2
  * Disable native flags in playbin2 temporarily since this is causing
    trouble with some videos. Also, allow videos with resolution 
    up to 848x576.
  * Added dirty hack to be aware of the volume changes that don't happen
    inside mafw code. As soon as GStreamer adds notify::volume signals, we
    have to remove this immediately.
  * Setting volume when playing is done only for playback volume.
  * Moved volume management from playback pipeline to volume pipeline. We
    don't update the volume pipeline because it should be updated but we do it
    with the playback one because it has always to be set up.
  * Moved listening to volume signals from playback pipeline to volume
    pipeline in renderer
  * Added customized pipeline to always listen to volume changes in renderer
  * Added support to distinguish between audio and video codec errors.
  * Fixed critical warning message.
  * When we get the ckey coming from the sync bus to the async bus, we check
    the caps and raise an error if they are not suitable.

mafw-test-gui (0.1.2009.17-2) unstable; urgency=low
  * MAFW Test GUI, pre-release 0.2009.17-2
  * Fixed a compilation warning.
  * No need to show an info note when we get metadata for an item that's 
    not in the view, just ignoring this is ok.
