mafw-tracker-source (0.1.2009.33-3) unstable; urgency=low
  * Reverting wrong key-mapping type 
    (Tracker does manipulate Playlist:ValidDuration as an
    integer even though MAFW handles it as a boolean).
  * Properly handle Playlist:ValidDuration (type boolean). This helps
    with improving performance of playlist queries (duration).
  * Patch By Antía Puentes Felpeto.
